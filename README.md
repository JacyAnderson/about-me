## What did you do before GA? 
### Before attending G.A. I was a touring guitarist, songwriter, and music instructor in the greater Boston area. I graduated from Berklee College of Music in May 2016 with a Bachelor of Arts in Songwriting & Professional Music, and soon thereafter decided I wanted to escape the rising prices and claustrophobic populations of the east coast and return to my home state of Colorado. 

## What kind of support do you need most from Outcomes?
### The support I need most from the Outcomes team is direction: as someone coming from a completely unrelated feel, I need assistance being paired with potential jobs that provide a stable, yet relaxed lifestyle that can be supported my other passions of music, and social justice advocacy.

## Day 1 Goals:
### Project goal - Build the basis of an interactive advocacy site ("The Bystander Buddy") with plenty of room to eventually grow and develop into iOS/Android applications.

### Personal Goal: Develop a healthier lifestyle/routine, and be able to turn creative ideas into a more stable future.

## Two Truths and a Lie
### 1) I have ten cats, two dogs, twenty-two cows, and five goats.
### 2) I have performed and opened for Lake Street Dive, Brad Paisley, and Lady Antebellum.
### 3) I once got stuck in O'hare airport for three days due to to a Noreaster in New England. 

## Describe what kind of company you'd like to work for:
### Right now I'm leaning towards working for a startup. I'm very passionate about products that impact users' everyday lives, and hope that I can be apart of that development community. That said, I am also open to working in large companies that also have main products they work with (Fortune 500s, etc).

## Describe what kind of role you're leaning towards (i.e. Frontend, Backend, etc):
### I LOVE the idea of being a front-end, UX developer that can have a huge impact on the visuals and flow of a final product. After talking with Nick, Will, and Nate (lunch and learn) I am interested in learning more about front end languages and how they can design a product and inspire user trust.  

All that said, I do also like the back end, but I feel that I need more time to fully cement some of the concepts in my mind. I'm totally open to Fullstack dev work.
